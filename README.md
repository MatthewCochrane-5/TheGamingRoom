# TheGamingRoom
Matthew Cochrane

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

- The Gaming Room is a game development company that wanted to design a picture-guessing game called Draw It or Lose It for use across all major platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

- I did a good job in outlining the differences between client and server side requirements for each platform.

What about the process of working htrough a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

- It helped keep my thoughts organized as well as focusing on the big picture of the application.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

- If given the opportunity, I would change how I formatted the UML diagram to ensure that there is no ambiguity in how I listed the different objects.

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?
